			         GNOME Manpages Editor
			         ---------------------

Gmanedit is an GNOME/Gtk Editor for Manual pages on Linux/Unix systems. 
The original code was written in 2001 by Sergio Rua and the program would 
run on the GNOME version 1 desktop environment.

Nothing happened since then and Sergio seemed to be unreachable, so in 
2008 Joop Stakenborg decided to port the program to the GNOME version 2 
and revive the project. Joop cleaned the code and turned Gmanedit into 
a GTK+ only application. 

After a hiatus I adopted the project and fixed existing bugs, improved 
the user interface and added new features.
