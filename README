			GNOME Manpages Editor
			---------------------

	Gmanedit is an GNOME/Gtk Editor for Manual pages on Linux/Unix
	systems. The original code was written in 2001 by Sergio Rua and
        the program would run on the GNOME version 1 desktop environment.

        Nothing happened since then and Sergio seems to be unreachable,
        so I decided to port the program to the GNOME version 2 and revive
        the project. What you see is a first version which has the same
        functionality as the old version, although it still uses some of
        the deprecated Gnome widgets.
