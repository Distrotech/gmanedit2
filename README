			         GNOME Manpages Editor
			         ---------------------

	Gmanedit is an GNOME/Gtk Editor for Manual pages on Linux/Unix
	systems. The original code was written in 2001 by Sergio Rua and
    the program would run on the GNOME version 1 desktop environment.

        Nothing happened since then and Sergio seemed to be unreachable,
        so I decided to port the program to the GNOME version 2 and revive
        the project. What you see is a second version which has the same
        functionality as the old version, there were many code cleanups and
        the program is now GTK+ only.
