   These are generic installation instructions for gmanedit.

   You should have the libgnomeui development headers and libraries 
   installed on your system. Next, run the configure script in the
   gmanedit source tree:

   ./configure
   make
   make install

   gmanedit will be installed in /usr/local/bin.
